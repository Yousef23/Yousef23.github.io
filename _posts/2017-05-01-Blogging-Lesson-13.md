  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that bubble sorting is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. An effective strategy of learning this was how we all stood up at the beginning of the lesson i a line and by following steps we would try and order each other from smallest to tallest.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>After we sat back down my understanding of bubble sorting was still not great and although I got the concept, I did not know how to do this in the least amount of steps possible. We watched a video which helped with this but I need to work on the habit of being more careful and taking more time when picking my next step of how to bubble sort something.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, it will be very important I understand bubble sorting fully, because for homework I have to incorporate bubble sorting into my repl IT account and try and making working functions and variables that will sort some items or people in minimal steps using bubble sorting.</td>
