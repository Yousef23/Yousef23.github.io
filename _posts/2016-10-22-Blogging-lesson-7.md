    <td>In today's lesson it was a get on with it kind of thing where we were given the freedom of just carrying on. I think I took good advantage of the time and was mature enough to get on with it instead of using the time unhelpfully. Just putting my head down and focusing was the most effective strategy because I had a lot to do to finish my google sheets to make it look like a company.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the first week so far I felt I didn't get distracted by my peers and things around me and felt I worked well using the time effectively. This meant my learning was in fact not that limited as I stayed on task. Perhaps if I had sped up a bit and not taken so long doing things I would have done more work so in future I need to learn to have more trust in my self and not go over something too many times because I am unsure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will, just like I did in this lesson, use my time effectively by really getting on with it. More specifically next time to improve my learning I can add formulas into my google sheets in less of a long winded ways using the if and elseif formulas available.</td>
