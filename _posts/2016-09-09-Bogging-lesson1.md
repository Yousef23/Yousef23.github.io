    <td>I learnt how to successfully make a blog on github using Gabriel. Taking notes during the lesson were effective strategies as it was very complicated and too much to remember. With my notes I could go back and follow the steps. Also using my common sense seemed to be helpful as the last stage I did not write down so I went to settings as it seemed logical that as it had not been published yet it would be something to do with settings. I then fixed the problem.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rushing limited my learning as I was so worried that i would forget it or mess up a step so  I tried doing each step too quickly which resulting in making mistakes. Also, I automatically turned to the teacher for help when all I had to do was put a few seconds thought into the problem and I would figure out a solution quite quickly.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>First of all I will only turn to the teacher if absolutely necessary and I have tried to solve a problem several times. As said earlier I will take my time and not rush, but at the same time don't start going off task and still be efficient. I will also listen to my teacher even more carefully and hopefully not even have to rely on notes as I will understand and remember whatever it is I'm doing as he"s showing us how.</td>
