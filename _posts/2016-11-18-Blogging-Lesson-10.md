    <td>I learnt some basic python code and how to convert pseudocode into python. Our task was to create a meal splitter to split a bill in python which I managed to successfully do after looking at the types of code like variables, floats and strings. After the teacher explaining how to use each of them, the task was quite straightforward.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I had not had an IT lesson from a while and a bit out of practice with python. It took a while to re-familiarise myself with the code and when error occurred it took me a lot longer than it needed to to fix it.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I think I will have remembered all the terms i have forgotten and make good progress. Hopefully it shouldn't take nearly as much time to fix errors as it did this week so I can get more work done and even try to get onto extension tasks and go beyond the expectation with my code.</td>
