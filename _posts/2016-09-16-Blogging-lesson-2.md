    <td>I learnt how to change the colours on my blog page using style.scss. I learnt first how to change the background colour, and after that I picked up how to do it and then I could my font colour and Headings. Listening really helped as the week before I made myself a target I would stop relying completely on notes and I did this by listening more carefully and picking each step up as my teacher went along.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although I did not ask the teacher like the week before, I was still unsure in my ability and would still try and get other students and say "is this right. " I need to work on being independent and not asking other students for reassurance when most of the time I had done it right. Also when other children asked for helped I just told them what to do which isn't helping anyone.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be more confident in my ability and focus purely on my work. I will stop getting distracted on other students and things around and I'll just have to get the confidence that whatever I have done is correct.</td>
