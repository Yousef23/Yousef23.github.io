    <td>Today was a discussion lesson. Unlike previous weeks, today we just sat at the front and talked about how to make a number guesser on Repl and we also talked about some common errors in code. Our homework was to make the number guesser, so it was important to listen to the teacher and not take the fact we weren't doing any work for granted. </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We would've got on to the work in the lesson if it wasn't for too much talking, and I was a contributor to that just as much as everyone else, so I need to work on concentration as I had many struggles with my number guesser on Repl at home which could have been easily fixed where there is a teacher available.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson, we will be continuing to work on Repl and I will improve my working by working on the structure of my code instead of just plonking in code that might work. I will create my function and variables in the right format. I will also make sure I am fully concentrated to limit mistakes.</td>
