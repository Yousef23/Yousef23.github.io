    <td>Today we were going to build a program in Python that asks the user to enter their first name and surname. Report back to the user information about the relative lengths of their names, try and personalise the answer. I think i completed this task effectively as i would follow  my target from last week which was to get better with code that refers to the user (my inputâ€¦) parts.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was i struggled to personalise it because I did not know how to correspond different lengths and letters to different paths down the code. I should work on my function and if, elif codes to improve this.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will go back to working on my blog for half the lesson and change the lookout of it. I will try and fix a problem that when i try and open one of the pictures it does not work. For the other half of the lesson I will go back to repl and complete the task set that week.</td>
