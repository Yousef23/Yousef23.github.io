    <td>I learnt some basic python code and how to convert pseudocode into python. Our task was to create a meal splitter to split a bill in python which I managed to successfully do after looking at the types of code like variables, floats and strings. After the teacher explaining how to use each of them, the task was quite straightforward. I understood how to make a calculator in pet years.</td>

    <td>We would've got on to the work in the lesson if it wasn't for too much talking, and I was a contributor to that just as much as everyone else, so I need to work on concentration as I had many struggles with my number guesser on Repl at home which could have been easily fixed where there is a teacher available.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson, we will be continuing to work on Repl and I will improve my working by working on the structure of my code instead of just plonking in code that might work. I will create my function and variables in the right format. I will also make sure I am fully concentrated to limit mistakes. Defining functions will mean that i will be able to give mhy var</td>
