    <td>I learnt how to create tables around each blog. I did this by first listening to the teacher, and then going onto w3 schools and using their tutorials. On the bits I did not quite understand, for example how to widen my table, I found the strategy of using my initiative was effective as I fount a useful tutorial on w3schools. Also, I had finished the table a bit early, so instead of wasting my time doing nothing, I noticed my colours were not great so I looked at some online and came up with better contrasting colours.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As i have been using github for three weeks now, i got a bit overconfident. I did two or three steps at a time which got a bit confusing and then when something went wrong, I had no idea what it was. I need to work on accuracy and making sure I don't make small mistakes because just missing out one bracket could mess up your whole website.</td>
