  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to use the vlookup formula, the countif formula, the if formula and the sum formula. We were first shown how to do the vlookup and I went away and did this without too many problems. After this i used my time effectively and went away to make a countif formula. I also did the if formula later for my delivery charge to change depending on the number of items.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was after i had successfully done the countif formula i had realised I was ahead of what the teacher had told us to do. Instead of going even further I got cocky and just wasted time and only did the if formula 10 minutes later. I need to work on wasting any time, even if i am ahead.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will always be working whether ahead or behind. I will use the formula explanation on sheets when stuck instead of asking Mr Keen or someone else in the class because it will probably explain it just as well. I will change my attitude towards the task and instead of getting frustrated I will be excited to try something new to make my formula better and more automatic.</td>
